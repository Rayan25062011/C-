###### examples
```java
// all python modules available and the built-in modules
from modules use requests;

class Main
{
    fn getWeather()
    {
        city = scan("Which country do you want? > ");
        r = requests.get(f"https://wttr.in/{city}");
        dump(r.text);
    }

    public static void main()
    {
        this.getWeather();
    }
}

```
## !!!NOTICE!!!
***EVERY C- file needs to implement a CLASS "Main" to wrap up the code.***

###### Goals
<sub> 

1. Make a package manager

2. Make it famous

3. Make Github add this programming language
