# C-
The C- programming language version 0.1.3

# Why
C- is a language heavily inspired by C and C++, but more simple

# Why should you use it
Tired of C? Use C-!

# Get Started
```
git clone https://github.com/Rayan25062011/C-
```
```
chmod +x src
```
```
cd src
```
```
python3 interpreter.py example.cm
```
Or simply available with <a href="https://github.com/Rayan25062011/cmp">cmp</a>

# examples
```cpp
// example.cm
class Main()
{
    function Main()
    {
        print("Hello World");
    }
}

```
# !!!NOTICE!!!
EVERY C- file needs to implement a CLASS "Main" and a function "Main" where all the code is in the function "Main", if it does not have them then your code Will fail.

# Goals
1. Make a package manager
2. Make it famous
3. Make Github add this programming language
