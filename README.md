# C-
The C- programming language

# Why
C- is a language heavily inspired by C and C++, but more simple

# Why should you use it
Tired of C? Use C-!

# examples
```cpp
var num = 5;
var num2 = 5;

if num == 5 and num2 == 5 {
  print("num and num2 are both equal to 5!");
};
else {
  print("Not equal");
}
```
